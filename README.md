# 📝 Word Counter — HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A clean and minimalist Word Counter application built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app allows users to paste or type text and instantly see:

- Total word count  
- Total character count  
- Number of unique words  
- A full frequency breakdown (word → count), sorted from most to least common  

This project recreates the logic of a classic Python word‑counting script, but redesigned as an interactive front‑end tool.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters text into the textarea.  
2. JavaScript extracts words using a regex pattern.  
3. A frequency dictionary is built (word → count).  
4. Results update instantly in the UI.  
5. The frequency list is sorted from highest to lowest.
